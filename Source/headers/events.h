minionsEvent class

This is the base class for scheduled events in Minions. 
 
Each event that requires different parms, will have it's
own event type class object derived from this base class.
Using this class as a base, allows us to determine its
type by using the eventType varible and calling 
obj->getEventObjectType(); which will allow us to call
the correct functions for that object type allowing
proper execution. It also holds the execution time. (eventTime)

Note: For consistency, all derived classes should start 
with "me" (M)inions (E)vent.  (ie, meCombat)
